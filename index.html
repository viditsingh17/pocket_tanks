            <p class="text">Students in today’s day and age face a number of problems which aren’t taken care of. Students don’t know which coaching/tutor to attend so that their time and money don’t get wasted and they get to learn the most. Many books are costly and people don’t want to buy new books as after the session they don’t need them. Either they are given to the juniors or the ragman. Some students make good notes which could be helpful to many others, but due to lack of a sustainable system, they only reach to some. 
                            Like mentioned above, there are a lot of problems that students face and Rapport is going to be a single mobile app that could solve most of these problems.
